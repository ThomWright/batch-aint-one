# Simulator

This directory contains a simple simulator for the `batch-aint-one` library, allowing you to test and observe the behavior of different batching strategies and configurations in a controlled environment. The simulator can be used to simulate various workloads and measure performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization.

Warning: it's pretty heavily vibe-coded and very WIP.
